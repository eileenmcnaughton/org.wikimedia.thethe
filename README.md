This extension alters the sort name saved for organisations. It allows you to remove the 'The' from the beginning. The sort name is used from quicksearch so removing optional strings makes it easier for users to search and to realise the contact already exists with or without the 'the'.

Having standardised sort names is also useful for doing deduping - sort_name can be used as a field in a rule and The Justice League can then be deduped with Justice League.

The extension also permits suffixes to be removed or strings to be removed from anywhere in the sort name. The prefixes and suffixes to be replaced can be configured under **Administer->Customize Data and Screens->Organization Sort Name Settings** (per the screenshot above).

Notes:

- The patterns are applied *in order*. So prefixes of `'the ', 'the university of '`will not fix `The University of Life`, because once the 'the' is removed, the second pattern no longer matches. So you would need to swap the order (or use just `'university of '` instead which *would* apply).

- If you want to replace single quotes you have to 'escape' them with 
  a backslash. For example, you could enter `"'\'s'"` as an anywhere pattern to change "Mary's" to "Mary". If doing this also watchout that *Mary’s* is not the same as *Mary's* and would need another pattern for the ’ character!

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Installation (CLI, Git)

Sysadmins and developers may clone the [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repo for this extension and

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FIXME/org.wikimedia.thethe.git
cv en thethe
```

## Usage

If you install this it will start removing the The from the start of the sort name
of any organization that is created or edited. This difference will be most noticeable
from quicksearch - especially in organizations that have turned off the Automatic Wildcard 
search setting (turning this off gives a substantial performance improvement on larger sites)

### Preview effects of settings

If you have access to the API4 explorer, you can call `Contact.previewThethe`. This will
look up one matching organization name for each of the strings you have set and
return an array with the (unchanged) `organization_name` and the new `sort_name` (and the contact ID).

This can be useful to figure out if you put the spaces in the right places etc.

## Known Issues

- This only addresses Organizations. It could easily be extended to Households but more
core changes would be needed for any changes to Individuals.

- The *prefix* and *suffix* patterns you choose are **not** case-sensitive; entering `'The '` as a pattern is the same as entering `'the '`.

- The *anywhere* patterns will only be removed if the `organization_name` 
  contains the *lowercase* version of the pattern. So an anywhere pattern of 'and ' will not remove *and* from an organisation called 'This And That'.

## Changes

Up to v 1.2, only ASCII characters were considered in a case-insensitive way; the pattern `université` would not match `UNIVERSITÉ`. As long as your PHP has the mbstring extension installed, this is fixed in later versions.
